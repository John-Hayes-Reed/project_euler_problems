# The problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Using implemented classes to get the solution

```ruby
# In an irb console

require_relative 'fibonacci_sequence'
#=> true

FibonacciSequence.call roof: 4_000_000
#=> [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887]

FibonacciSequence.call(roof: 4_000_000).reduce(0) { |sum, n| n.even? ? sum + n : sum }
#=> 4613732
